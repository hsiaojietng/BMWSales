## Business Context
BMW EuroDrive, a key regional sales division based in Singapore, manages the distribution and sales performance of luxury vehicles across diverse international markets including Europe, North America, and Asia. As the automotive industry shifts toward electrification and sustainable mobility, the company must balance its traditional high-performance internal combustion engine (ICE) heritage with a rapidly expanding fleet of electric (i-series) and hybrid models. Current market conditions are characterized by fluctuating regional demand, varied fuel-type preferences, and a highly competitive luxury segment where pricing strategies directly impact sales velocity and market share.
​

## Problem Background
Despite a robust portfolio spanning from the entry-level 1 Series to the high-performance M5 and flagship i8, BMW EuroDrive has observed inconsistent sales classifications across its global regions. Preliminary reports indicate that certain high-performance models are struggling in regions where fuel prices have spiked, while newer electric models like the i3 show erratic performance despite aggressive subsidies in specific markets. The sales manager is currently unable to pinpoint the exact combination of "Price-to-Mileage" efficiency and "Model-Year" relevance that consistently triggers a "High" Sales Classification, leading to overstocked inventory in underperforming regions.

## Stakeholder Request
"Our global sales data from 2010 to 2024 shows a fragmented performance landscape. I need you to determine which specific vehicle configurations—focusing on the interplay between FuelType, MileageKM, and Region—are the primary drivers of our 'High' sales volume category. Specifically, I want to know if our pricing for high-mileage electric vehicles in North America is competitive enough to maintain market leadership, or if we are losing ground to cheaper internal combustion alternatives."
